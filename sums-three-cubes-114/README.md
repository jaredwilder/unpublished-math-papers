This directory preserves the exact modular mathematics recovered for

\[
a^3+b^3+c^3=114.
\]

The equation itself is **not claimed solved** here.

## Main exact theorem — exactly one variable is divisible by 7

Every integer solution of

\[
a^3+b^3+c^3=114
\]

has **exactly one** of `a,b,c` divisible by `7`.

### Proof

The cubic residues modulo 7 are

\[
\{0,1,6\}=\{0,1,-1\}.
\]

Also

\[
114\equiv2\pmod7.
\]

The only way three elements of `{0,1,-1}` can sum to `2 mod 7` is, up to permutation,

\[
0+1+1.
\]

Thus exactly one of `a^3,b^3,c^3` is `0 mod 7`, and the other two are `1 mod 7`. Since

\[
x^3\equiv0\pmod7\iff x\equiv0\pmod7,
\]

exactly one of `a,b,c` is divisible by 7.

A convenient root-cause formulation is:

\[
\boxed{2\text{ is not a cubic residue modulo }7.}
\]

## Mod-9 structure

The cubic residues modulo 9 are

\[
\{0,1,8\}.
\]

Since

\[
114\equiv6\pmod9,
\]

any solution must have all three cubes congruent to `8 mod 9`. Consequently every variable is
congruent to `2 mod 3`.

## CRT sieve modulo 21

Combining the mod-3 and mod-7 conditions gives the following exact residue architecture after choosing
which variable is the unique multiple of 7:

| variable role | mod 3 | mod 7 | mod 21 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| unique multiple-of-7 variable | `2` | `0` | `14` |
| first nonzero-mod-7 variable | `2` | `{1,2,4}` | `{8,2,11}` |
| second nonzero-mod-7 variable | `2` | `{1,2,4}` | `{8,2,11}` |

Using symmetry for the choice of the multiple-of-7 coordinate, this leaves a theoretical fraction

\[
\frac1{21}\left(\frac3{21}\right)^2\cdot3
=\frac1{343}
\]

of the naive residue search space.

The historical CPU runs measured the practical consequence as approximately the same factor:

```text
unsieved search: H=5,000 in ~176 s
mod-21 sieved search: H=20,000 in ~44 s
```

Those bounded searches are tooling evidence, not a literature-level nonexistence result.

## Lean 4 formalization inventory

The original Lean source bytes were referenced by path in the surviving estate but were not recovered
as a standalone Library file in this extraction. This README therefore publishes the exact theorem
inventory and mathematics without fabricating source code.

## Conditional / heuristic layer — deliberately not promoted

The May campaign also computed partial singular-series products and used a Heath-Brown-style density
heuristic to estimate very large first-solution scales for `k=114`. Those numbers remain **conditional
heuristics**. They are not used in any theorem above and are not evidence that no integer solution
exists.

## Scope boundary

- `k=114` remains open in this release.
- The mod-7 theorem and mod-21 sieve are unconditional elementary arithmetic.
- The bounded PARI searches are finite computations only.
- The first-solution-height estimates are conditional heuristics only.
- No historical-priority claim is attached to the elementary modular facts.
